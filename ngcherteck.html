    <h1>OFFICIAL CONFESSION STATEMENT</h1><div class="content">
    <p>I, <strong>Ng Cher Teck</strong>, hereby declare that my previous statements and posts were false and untrue. These were made under the instruction of my manager, <strong>Alven Tan Hao Jia</strong>. I was coerced into echoing his words under the threat of termination from my employment at <strong>KL Transportation Services</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>At the time, I complied without fully realizing that <strong>Alven Tan Hao Jia</strong> was a known scammer. His conflict with <strong>Xi Ping</strong> arose when Xi Ping shared documentary evidence exposing his scams. This revelation disrupted our fraudulent activities, forcing our company to disguise itself as a scam-busting entity.</p>
    
    <p>Due to <strong>Alven Tan Hao Jiaâ€™s</strong> failure to pay my salary, I have decided to disclose the truth. The group <strong>Scam Alert By United Singapore</strong>, founded by <strong>Tan Kok Liang</strong> and <strong>Alven Tan Hao Jia</strong>, is a front for fraudulent activities. Both individuals have been reported by media outlets such as <em>Stomp, Mothership, and The Straits Times</em> for their involvement in multiple scams. They now operate under anonymous profiles to avoid detection, as their real identities have lost credibility.</p>
    
    <p>I deeply regret my involvement in spreading falsehoods and sincerely apologize for my past actions. I urge the public to be aware that the real scammers are:</p>
    
    <p><strong>KL Transportation Services (UEN: 53444733C)</strong>, managed by <strong>Tan Kok Liang (NRIC: S9739469E)</strong>, residing at <strong>Blk 352C Canberra Road, Singapore 753352</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>This statement is made voluntarily and without external pressure. I acknowledge my past mistakes and wish to rectify the damage caused by my previous statements.</p>
