    <h1>OFFICIAL CONFESSION STATEMENT</h1><div class="content">
    <p>I, <strong>Alven Tan Hao Jia (NRIC: S9832353H)</strong>, hereby declare and admit that I have committed various scams, including but not limited to:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Free Cycling Scam</li>
        <li>Fake Friend Scam</li>
        <li>Love Scam</li>
        <li>Extortion</li>
        <li>Bank Account Scam</li>
        <li>Human Trafficking</li>
        <li>Drug Trafficking</li>
        <li>Selling Young Womenâ€™s Nudity</li>
        <li>Harassment Towards Young Women</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>All the accusations made against me were, in fact, true and factual. I sincerely apologize to <strong>SG Ahsiao</strong> and the rest of his organization. After they exposed my scams, I resorted to impersonation and fabricated stories against them in an attempt to retain my credibility.</p>
    
    <p>I created the group <strong>Scam Alert By United Singapore</strong> and falsely presented myself as a scam buster. I deliberately misled numerous scam victims, falsely claiming that they had been scammed by <strong>SGAhsiao</strong>, when in reality, I was the one who had scammed them. After deceiving these victims, I created another profile to contact them, pretending to assist them while further manipulating them.</p>
    
    <p>Today, I confess to all my misdeeds in the hope of seeking forgiveness from my victims. I do not have the financial means to repay the money I have stolen, but I humbly ask for forgiveness and pledge to change for the better. To those I have scammed, if I cannot repay you in this life, perhaps I will in my next life.</p>
