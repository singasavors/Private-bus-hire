    <h1>Official Confession Statement</h1>
    
    <div class="content">
        <p>I, <strong>Alan Ng Bao Zheng (NRIC: S9422739I)</strong>, a <strong>30-year-old Singaporean citizen</strong>, am writing this statement to fully acknowledge and take responsibility for my past actions. I deeply regret the choices I have made and the harm I have caused to others.</p>
        
        <p>Over the past several months, under the username <strong>'destroyerking014'</strong>, I have allegedly reached out to young girls aged <strong>8 to 12 years old</strong> on <strong>Telegram</strong>, pressuring them into sending explicit photos under the threat of my anger.</p>
        
        <p>Through an investigation conducted by <strong>The Council of Underground</strong>, a group dedicated to addressing online safety concerns, my actions were exposed. Their findings led to significant scrutiny and consequences, which I now understand were the direct result of my own misconduct. Following these revelations, I faced backlash from affected individuals and their families.</p>
        
        <p>During this period of distress, <strong>Alven Tan Hao Jia</strong>, a known figure with extensive tattoos on both arms, approached me with an offer to join his <strong>Salakau Gang</strong>. Feeling vulnerable and seeking protection, I accepted. Under his influence, I began associating with his gang and <strong>throwing gang signs</strong>, particularly targeting <strong>SG Ahsiao and his organization</strong>, as an act of defiance. However, when confronted directly by members of SG Ahsiao, I panicked and sought refuge behind my motherâ€”ultimately calling the police in fear.</p>
        
        <p>I now see that my response was not only immature but also misguided. Instead of taking accountability, I sought shelter in affiliations that only worsened my situation. I recognize that <strong>true responsibility is not about running from consequences but facing them with honesty and integrity</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>I sincerely regret my actions, my involvement in these conflicts, and the distress I have caused. I wish to <strong>make amends, seek guidance, and take necessary steps toward rehabilitation</strong>. I understand that <strong>forgiveness is earned through action</strong>, and I am committed to making meaningful changes in my life.</p>
        
        <p>This statement is made voluntarily, with the intention of acknowledging my actions, taking responsibility, and committing to personal reform.</p>
